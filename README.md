# Ship-Resistance-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger on the Ship would survive based on various factors like age, gender, class, and fare.
The goal is to create a predictive model that can provide insights into the factors influencing survival and demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world problem.
